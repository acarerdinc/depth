# depth

Single image depth prediction with capsule networks.

I tried to design an autoencoder like structure based on capsule networks under the assumption that 
capsule networks are essentially autoencoders in nature and are capable of encoding the relative object 
information in the input image which then can be used by the decoder to estimate the relative depth information.
